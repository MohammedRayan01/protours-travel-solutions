          “Non-refundable components” are the costs in section 6 that we have already paid to suppliers or
          governments for your booking and cannot recover. Your written quote lists them. A refund is never
          less than zero, and we never ask you to pay more than the package price because you cancelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> package price ₹1,00,000, of which ₹8,000 is a visa fee already paid. You
          cancel 20 days before departure: 50% of ₹1,00,000 = ₹50,000, minus ₹8,000 = <strong>₹42,000
          refunded</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Umrah:</strong> once flights and Makkah/Madinah hotels are confirmed and paid, Umrah visa,
          Nusuk and related service charges already paid to Saudi authorities or licensed providers are
          non-refundable. <strong>Hajj:</strong> cancellation and refunds follow the rules of the Haj
          Committee of India or the registered Hajj Group Organiser concerned, which we will give you in
          writing before you pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Changing instead of cancelling:</strong> ask us. If suppliers allow it, we can often move
          your dates or transfer the booking to someone else for only the supplier’s charges.

          If something is wrong with a payment, please contact us first — most issues are sorted within a
          day. If you raise a chargeback or dispute with your bank, we will share your booking, payment and
          cancellation records with the bank and payment provider to respond. If the services were supplied
          or the charge was valid under this policy, we may contest the dispute and recover amounts wrongly
          reversed, including supplier costs already incurred.
