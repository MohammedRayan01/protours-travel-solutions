      <LegalSection title="1. Who we are">
        <p>
          {BIZ.name} is an IATA-accredited travel agent run by {BIZ.owner} from {BIZ.addressOneLine},
          India. Phone / WhatsApp {BIZ.phoneDisplay}, email{' '}
          <a href={`mailto:${BIZ.email2}`} className={a}>{BIZ.email2}</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trading in Bengaluru since {BIZ.since}, we arrange flights, hotels, tour packages, visas, passport assistance, cruises, and Hajj &amp; Umrah
          travel. These terms apply to this website and to every booking you make with us — online, on
          WhatsApp, by phone, by email or at our office. By booking or paying, you accept these terms, our{' '}

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="2. Our role as your agent">
        <p>
          We are a booking agent. The flight, hotel room, cruise, transfer or tour is provided by the airline,
          hotel, cruise line or local operator (the “supplier”), and their own terms and conditions — fare
          rules, check-in times, baggage rules, cancellation terms — also apply to you. We will share the key
          supplier terms with you before you pay, and full terms on request.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="3. Quotes and prices">
        <p>
          We don't publish prices on this website; every booking is quoted to you individually. Package
          quotes are per person on twin sharing unless we say otherwise.
        </p>
        <LegalList
          items={[
            'Every quote is itemised in writing (WhatsApp or email) and shows the total you will pay, including taxes (such as GST and any TCS on overseas packages) and our service fee. No hidden charges are added later.',
            'Airfares, hotel rates and visa fees are set by suppliers and governments and can change until the booking is paid and issued. If a price changes before that, we will tell you and you can choose not to go ahead.',
            'Things not included in the quote (for example, tips, personal expenses, optional tours, excess baggage) are listed as exclusions.',

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="4. How a booking is confirmed">
        <p>
          An enquiry or a quote is not a booking. A booking is confirmed only when we have received your
          payment (or the agreed deposit) and sent you a confirmation — an e-ticket, hotel voucher, visa
          application receipt or written booking confirmation. Please check names, dates and details on it
          straight away; names must match passports exactly, and airlines may charge for corrections.

            'Online payments are processed by Razorpay, a PCI-DSS compliant payment gateway. We never see or store your card, UPI or net-banking credentials.',
            'Online charges are made in Indian Rupees. If you pay with a foreign card, your bank converts the amount and may add its own currency-conversion fee.',
            'Cash payments are accepted only within the limits set by Indian law, and you will always get a receipt.',
            'For packages, the balance is due by the date shown on your confirmation. If it is not paid on time, suppliers may release the booking and our cancellation terms apply.',

          airspace closures, government orders or changes to visa or entry rules. In such cases we will
          help you rebook or recover whatever refund the supplier gives.
