        <p>
          Families often book for children, and minors need their own passports, visas and tickets. Under
          Indian law a child is anyone under 18.

      <LegalSection title="6. Who we share it with">
        <p>We share your data only with those who need it to deliver what you asked for:</p>
        <LegalList
          items={[
            'Airlines and airline booking systems (GDS), hotels, transport and local tour operators for your trip.',
            'Embassies, consulates, visa application centres (e.g. VFS Global, BLS International) and online visa portals; Passport Seva for passport services.',
            'For Umrah and Hajj: the Saudi authorities and platforms (such as Nusuk), and the licensed operators in Saudi Arabia who provide your visa, hotel and transport; for Hajj, also the Government of India / Haj Committee processes that apply.',

            'Payment processors and banks (Razorpay, when used) to take payments and send refunds.',

        <p>
          Many of these are outside India because that is where you are travelling. We send only what the
          recipient needs, and we follow any restrictions the Government of India places on transfers to
          particular countries.

          ]}
        />
        <p>
          When the purpose is over and no law requires us to keep the data, we delete it. Original

            <><strong>Erase</strong> — delete your data once it is no longer needed, unless the law requires us to keep it.</>,
            <><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> — as easily as you gave it. Withdrawal does not undo what was lawfully done before, and if a booking or visa is already in progress we may not be able to complete it without the data. Supplier cancellation charges may then apply.</>,
            <><strong>Nominate</strong> someone to exercise these rights for you if you die or become unable to act.</>,

        <p>
          <strong>How:</strong> send a WhatsApp message or email to the Grievance Officer (section 11) saying
          what you want. We may ask you to confirm your identity before sharing or changing anything. We
          will acknowledge your request within 48 hours and act on it as soon as we can — within 30 days,
          and in any case within the time the law allows. There is no charge.
